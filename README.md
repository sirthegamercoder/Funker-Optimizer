# Trivia
- Actually the name Funker' Optimizer is inspired from the name of [Funkin' Optimizer](https://github.com/WhiteNinja00/Funkin-Optimizer) by [WhiteNinja00](https://github.com/WhiteNinja00)
  - The reason I made this tool is because one of the feature is where can crop spritesheet but drawback is can increase file size so I decided to make a tool with adding a feature resize the image also reduce file size
- Funker' Optimizer was originally is Divider XML PC which has unfortunately been removed since February 27th
- Funker' Optimizer application icon is also inspired by Funkin' Optimizer application icon, except that the letters are combined and shaded
- Since threading was removed in 1.1.1 the image resizing process may take a long time
